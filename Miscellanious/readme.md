# Miscellanious
### Crap that I've decided to keep away from the other crap.

**[JSMaterialThemeCodeblocks](https://github.com/Arashiryuu/crap/blob/master/Miscellanious/JSMaterialThemeCodeblocks.plugin.js)** ー Edits Discord's syntax-highlighting for JavaScript codeblocks to *somewhat* fit the Material Theme as available in Sublime, Atom, VisualStudio etc.

**[charCounterV2](https://github.com/Arashiryuu/crap/blob/master/Miscellanious/charCounterV2.plugin.js)** ー Adds a character counter to the textarea; warns when going over Discord's character limit; originally made by Jiiks, tweaked and updated by Arashiryuu.
